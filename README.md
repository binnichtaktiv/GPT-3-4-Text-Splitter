# GPT-3/4 Text Splitter
Splits a large text into smaller texts so that you can send it to GPT3/4 or whatver

It automatically divides the texts into the size that gpt can process. (the size may be changed in the future)

Before you can use it do `pip install nltk` 

It takes the text from a .txt file in which you have to paste your text before 

(This is easier because pasting everything directly in the terminal only causes problems)
